# Lotto Number Generator

## Overview

This is a small multi-page project hub that links to a lotto generator and an animal face test site (Teachable Machine), with each app served from its own path.

## Detailed Outline

1. **Project Hub (Root)**
   - Simple landing page with two cards linking to each app.
2. **Lotto Generator (`/lotto/`)**
   - Adjustable game count (1–10).
   - Animated number drawing with color-coded number ranges.
   - Copy-all results button.
   - Formspree partner inquiry form.
   - Disqus comments embed.
3. **Animal Face Test (`/animal-face-test/`)**
   - Teachable Machine webcam-based classifier.
   - Live probability bars and status badge.
   - Setup guide and model folder note.

## Current Plan

1. Move the lotto app into `/lotto/`.
2. Add a root landing page linking to both `/lotto/` and `/animal-face-test/`.
3. Commit and push changes for deployment.
